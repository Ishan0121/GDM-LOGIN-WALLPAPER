# GDM Login Screen Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

A simple yet powerful set of bash scripts to **backup**, **change**, and **restore** the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) login screen wallpaper on Fedora Workstation (tested on Fedora 42 with GNOME 48.2).

---

## Why?

Fedora's GDM login screen wallpaper isn't easily customizable by default. These scripts let you:

- Save your current login theme safely.
- Swap in a custom wallpaper of your choosing.
- Restore everything back to Fedora‚Äôs original pristine state.

---

## Contents

- `main.sh` ‚Äî The wizard menu script that ties everything together.
- `backup-theme.sh` ‚Äî Backs up your current GDM theme locally and system-wide.
- `set-wallpaper.sh` ‚Äî Changes the GDM login wallpaper.
- `restore-theme.sh` ‚Äî Restores the GDM theme from backup.

---

## Usage

1. **Clone this repo or download scripts**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishan0121/GDM-LOGIN-WALLPAPER.git
cd GDM-LOGIN-WALLPAPER
chmod +x *.sh
````

2. **Run the main wizard script**

```bash
./main.sh
```

3. **Choose your option**

- `1` to backup your current theme (always do this first!)
- `2` to change the login wallpaper (make sure your desired wallpaper is in the correct path as specified in `set-wallpaper.sh`)
- `3` to restore the original theme from backup

---

## Notes

- **Root permissions** required for modifying system files ‚Äî you will be prompted for your sudo password.
- Tested on Fedora Workstation 42 with GNOME Shell 48.2.
- Backup files are stored both locally (`./theme-backup/`) and system-wide (`/usr/share/gnome-shell/`).
- Make sure your wallpaper image has the correct permissions and path in `set-wallpaper.sh`.

---

## Customize Your Wallpaper

- Place your desired wallpaper in the location specified by `set-wallpaper.sh` (default: `./wallpapers/login-wallpaper.jpg`).
- Modify the script if you want to use a different image or location.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you experience a broken GDM or UI glitches, use option `3` in the wizard to restore the original theme.
- Always run the backup script before making changes.
